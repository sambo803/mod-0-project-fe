## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
From the article, the ZPD (Zone of Proximal Development) makes sense, that you'll get optimal growth in your 'sweet spot', not
overwhelmed nor under-challenged. The second point was from the video where Carmen referred to the book on Growth Mindset from Carol Dwick? in which she mentioned the fixed vs. growth mindsets. I find this encouraging, that one can change for the better on into the future.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I believe that I'm demonstrating a growth mindset by taking on the Turing School. I believe I'll have a brighter future by doing so.
I do not when I listen to my Big Meany of a voice inside telling me 'What are you doing!? You can't do that, you're too old, etc..'

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
Well, it wasn't bad at all, as I felt that I still remembered node, for one. Secondly, the reading gave pretty good direction
on the assignments. I feel that even with the added challenges, it is nowhere near as hard as the homeworks have been for me.
They have been particularly disorienting and uncomfortable. Compared to them, the Project has been thoroughly enjoyable for me.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
An if/then statement is conditional. An example of a daily life conditional is: If I feel good about my ability to succeed in Turing, I will give my 3-week notice to my boss tomorrow! (True by the way) :)
A conditional web-app example is probably when I'm clicking on funny videos on Instagram, the program is being prompted to show more
funny videos that are related somehow.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You can say If a, then do 1. Else if not a, then do 2. Else if b, then 3. Else if not b, then do 4...
The program does the first true statment, executes it. So one must think that way, of what the computer is going to want to do next.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Logical operators, if/ else and more if/else statement as in the above example.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Hmmm, I don't know? How prevalent they are in real complicated code of industry?
