## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
I ask them too soon usually. It's hard to take note of when I'm going 'down the rabbit hole.'
By the time I realize I'm stuck, it may have been a while.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Numbers, what they sound like. Strings, can be text or some exact thing you want to insert. Booleans,
true or false statements that greatly help in coding.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!");
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// or /* and */  They allow the test to be ignored by the computer; you can also have code
'ignored' or skipped over with them.
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
Something we describe with a word. It is something we use to get the computer to do something
to or with the word.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Numbers, strings, booleans. Object names used in searches on Instagram.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Adding together strings and numbers to have a string say what you want it to.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
google. On any search with each word added.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Can I keep up? Are there trick questions contained in every assignment?
