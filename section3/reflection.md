## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?
Not too bad, adjusting a bit to the new environs of Mac, Slack, and group interactions.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Spotify, especially on your various playlists.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
Array methods are features of arrays, such as pop, which adds to the keyword 'array' after
a period, giving it special powers to perform some special function. In this example, the pop
is useful for 'popping' the last value of an array off the list and displaying it to the console and changing the number of the values in the array (length).

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
Loops are useful for doing something given certain conditions, and executing code that is preset and based on conditions that you prescribe. We would use loops in conjunction with arrays if there is a list of data (array) that we have to execute the code for all of it. It is much easier (and way less tedious) to use loops with arrays in such cases.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
Loops are used in programming to make tasks easier. The computer does something you want it to do, for example compare values and then tell it to say, I picked up my toys so I get a snack. If the child doesn't, then it says, sorry you didn't pick up your toys, so no snack for you. Loops can even do this for a whole class of students, but it needs to know: the student and did they pick up their toys? Then it can very quickly tell which child gets a snack or not.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Just how to utilize them in all sorts of situations, which I'm sure we'll learn.
